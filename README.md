# Dead By Daylight Skillcheck Expert

## Installation


## How does it work?

1. The player presses the keys "CTRL-O" when a skillcheck is onscreen
1. The program logs the time of this keypress
1. The program takes a screenshot of the screen the user is currently focused on
1. The program finds the location of the red bar (where the skillcheck currently is)
1. The program finds the location of the white square (where the program should press space)
1. The program presses space after it has waited (time to render image - time until reached white square)
1. Skillcheck complete!
